# Chatbot beta
## Rasa Open Source

Rasa is an open source machine learning framework to automate text-and voice-based conversations. With Rasa, you can build contextual assistants on:
- Facebook Messenger
- Slack
- Google Hangouts
- Webex Teams
- Microsoft Bot Framework
- Rocket.Chat
- Mattermost
- Telegram
- Twilio
- Your own custom conversational channels

or voice assistants as:
- Alexa Skills
- Google Home Actions

Rasa helps you build contextual assistants capable of having layered conversations with
lots of back-and-forth. In order for a human to have a meaningful exchange with a contextual
assistant, the assistant needs to be able to use context to build on things that were previously
discussed â€“ Rasa enables you to build assistants that can do this in a scalable way.

```bash
rasa train nlu -u dataset/your_data/ --config custom_config.yml --out outPutmodel
```
In the end of traning rasa will generate a document.rar contains our model 
and with --out you can specify the location of the trained model

### Run the trained model

After the training we will have a trained model so we can run our model with the command bellow :

```bash
rasa run -m outPutmodel --enable-api -p your_port --cors "*" --debug
```

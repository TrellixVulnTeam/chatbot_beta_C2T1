Expose diagnostic data for action and NLU predictions.

Add `diagnostic_data` field to the [Message](./reference/rasa/shared/nlu/training_data/message.md#message-objects)
and [Prediction](./reference/rasa/core/policies/policy.md#policyprediction-objects) objects, which contain
information about attention weights and other intermediate results of the inference computation.
This information can be used for debugging and fine-tuning, e.g. with [RasaLit](https://github.com/RasaHQ/rasalit).

For examples of how to access the diagnostic data, see [here](https://gist.github.com/JEM-Mosig/c6e15b81ee70561cb72e361aff310d7e).
